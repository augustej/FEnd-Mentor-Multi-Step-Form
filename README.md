## Overview

### The challenge
- Challenge included examples of 1440px and 375px width screens
- I did not use Pro account features (no Figma, most of design margins/font-size was my best guess)

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Object Oriented JS
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- How to use JS object oriented style (my first time)
- How to use float property to make text float around image
- How to use SCSS (my first time)
- How to style checkbox and ol elements

### Continued development

I would like to continue using OO JS, because it makes my code cleaner. However, it requires extra effort and I hope to improve my skills and turn it into my usual mindflow and workflow.
